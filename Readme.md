This is video series from chai aur backend w/ JavaScript

[Model link] (https://app.eraser.io/workspace/lfqrTtRPFebP7vM9f7Zg?origin=share)
copied this above link from eraser.io --> Share->copy link

After this, terminal-> git init

go to github-> create new repo (Backend_15/11/2024) 

Now change the branch here(vs code) in terminal by "git branch -M main". Coz our branch was earlier "Master".

then copy"git remote add origin https://github.com/Shrishti2698/Backend_15-11-2024.git" from hithub doc and paste in terminal here. We cant push the code into github intill origin is set. 
By this, it knows where to push the code now onwards.

Then "git push -u origin main"
